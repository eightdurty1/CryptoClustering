# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

## Project Description
The **Cryptocurrency Clustering Project** aims to identify patterns and group cryptocurrencies based on their market data, such as price changes over different time frames. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, including K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), this project simplifies the data and provides meaningful insights into the cryptocurrency market. The project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using both raw scaled data and PCA-reduced data, comparing their clustering efficiency, and visualizing the results for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling DataFrames.
- **hvPlot**: For interactive visualization of data and clusters.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning operations, including scaling, clustering, and PCA.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment to run and test Python code interactively.

## Features
- Data normalization using `StandardScaler` to standardize the market data.
- K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies into distinct clusters based on scaled data.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data and enhance clustering performance.
- Interactive visualizations to compare Elbow curves and clusters from both raw and PCA-reduced data.
- Scatter plots of cryptocurrency clusters, enabling easy identification of group characteristics.
